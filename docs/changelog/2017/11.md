## 2.0.0-alpha.1 (2017-11-23)
Complete rewrite of ReDoc using React so here only major changes are listed.
Complete rewrite also means that this rewrite may introduce issues, but they should be resolved before `2.0.0`.

### Features
- Basic Support for OpenAPI 3
- Usage as a React component

### Deprecations
- Fonts are not loaded by ReDoc so you should load them. Default fonts can be loaded as below:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat:300,400,700|Roboto:300,400,700" rel="stylesheet">
```
- no more bower releases
- no more GitHub pages-based CDN. Use [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/) to access ReDoc releases

### Known Regression (will be resolved before leaving alpha stage)
- `lazyLoading` option not implemented yet
- Copying to clipboard of samples not implemented yet
- Search not implemented yet

## [1.19.3](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc/compare/v1.19.2...v1.19.3) (2017-11-16)
### Bug Fixes
* html characters not escaped in code blocks (fixes [#378](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc/issues/378)) ([fef9ec4](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc/commit/fef9ec4))

## [1.19.2](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc/compare/v1.19.1...v1.19.2) (2017-11-10)
